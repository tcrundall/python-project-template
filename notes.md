# Notes

A place to gather my thoughts and outline future work.

## Actions

- [x] add linter
- [x] add pre-commit hooks to run linter
    - not quite working as I want
    - use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to actually do this
- [x] add dev dependencies to `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] add github workflow that auto runs tests
